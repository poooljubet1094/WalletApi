# WalletApi

This is a test given by a company.

To run this:
1. Run the ./SQLScript/SQLCreateWebApiDatabase.sql. This will create a new database, tables, stored procedures.
2. Change the config for your local database in appsettings.json
3. Run the application.

There are things I want to improve if I have more time.
1. Implement Authentication and Authorization.
2. Implement more definitive names for the routes such as api version and currency.
3. Implement database indexes.
